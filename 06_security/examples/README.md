- Membership inference attack simulation
- GDPR compliance demonstration

**Results Analysis**:
```
=== Differential Privacy vs Accuracy Trade-off ===

Epsilon = 0.5 (High Privacy):
- Accuracy: 58.3%
- Attack success: 52% (Safe)

Epsilon = 1.0 (Medium Privacy):
- Accuracy: 60.0%
- Attack success: 58% (Safe)

Epsilon = 5.0 (Low Privacy):
- Accuracy: 89.0%
- Attack success: 75% (Risky)
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- üîí **Privacy Protection**: Œµ < 1.0 provides excellent protection
- üìä **Accuracy Trade-off**: Higher privacy = lower accuracy
- üõ°Ô∏è **Attack Resistance**: Membership inference attacks reduced to near-random
- ‚úÖ **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy by design implementation

**Privacy Levels**:
- **High Privacy** (Œµ = 0.1-1.0): Recommended for sensitive data
- **Medium Privacy** (Œµ = 1.0-3.0): Balanced approach
- **Low Privacy** (Œµ > 3.0): Maximum accuracy, higher risk

**Use Cases**:
- Healthcare data analysis
- Financial transaction analysis
- Social media recommendation systems
- Government data processing

### 3. SHAP Model Explanation (`shap_example.py`)

**Purpose**: Demonstrates model interpretability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

**Key Features**:
- XGBoost model training with synthetic data
- SHAP explainer initialization and value computation
- Interactive visualization of feature importance
- Foundation for explainable AI implementations

**Code Structure**:
```python
# Generate sample data and train an XGBoost model
X, y = np.random.rand(100, 5), np.random.randint(2, size=100)
model = xgboost.XGBClassifier().fit(X, y)

# Initialize SHAP explainer for the trained model
explainer = shap.Explainer(model)

# Compute SHAP values for the first instance
shap_values = explainer(X[:1])

# Display SHAP summary plot
shap.summary_plot(shap_values)
```

**Performance Metrics**:
- üéØ **Model Training**: Fast training with synthetic data
- üìä **Explanation Generation**: Real-time SHAP value computation
- üñºÔ∏è **Visualization**: Interactive feature importance plots
- üîß **Integration**: Easy integration with existing ML pipelines

**Use Cases**:
- Model debugging and validation
- Feature importance analysis
- Regulatory compliance (explainable AI)
- Stakeholder communication
- Model performance optimization
